The goal of this dashboard was to allow users to manage their own accounts, increase customer/business communications, and simplify access and registration.</p>\n<h3>Key Requirements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Group users by company or organization</li>\n<li>Restrict registrations to valid and/or approved customers</li>\n<li>Implement badges and rewards</li>\n<li>Notifications system for sharing information with users</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Additional Features and Considerations</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\"Unlockable\" gated content</li>\n<li>Access logging and automated reporting</li>\n<li>Analytics implementation</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Build Process</h3>\n<p>For this build it was necessary to work within the confines of the client's enterprise systems. Due to size and exposure, it was necessary to develop the entirety of the project in a firwalled development portal for testing and legal review.</p>\n<h3>Custom Registrations</h3>\n<p>For registrations a passkey-based registration model was implemented where a valid key would be required to complete registration and to join an organization. Organizations would each receive a private key they could then share with their members for registration.</p>\n<h3>Badges</h3>\n<p>Badges (or custom flags) were added for particular achievements, such as completing a particular task, filling out additional registration information, or after reading through specific documentation. Additionally multi-level content gating was added allowing content to be \"revealed\" based on particular achievements or badges.</p>\n<h3>Widgetized Dashboard</h3>\n<p>The remainder of the build included building widgets for notifications, quick links, documentation and more. These were aded to a custom dashboard page for registred users, and changed based on organizationa availability, badges and achievements.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"August 07, 2019","slug":"drupal-portal-and-dashboard","title":"Custom User Dashboard in Drupal","featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"src":"/static/baf00f0febe44b7e9dedf2e3271c433b/ee604/thinkabitlab.png","srcSet":"/static/baf00f0febe44b7e9dedf2e3271c433b/69585/thinkabitlab.png 200w,\n/static/baf00f0febe44b7e9dedf2e3271c433b/497c6/thinkabitlab.png 400w,\n/static/baf00f0febe44b7e9dedf2e3271c433b/ee604/thinkabitlab.png 800w","srcWebp":"/static/baf00f0febe44b7e9dedf2e3271c433b/58556/thinkabitlab.webp","srcSetWebp":"/static/baf00f0febe44b7e9dedf2e3271c433b/61e93/thinkabitlab.webp 200w,\n/static/baf00f0febe44b7e9dedf2e3271c433b/1f5c5/thinkabitlab.webp 400w,\n/static/baf00f0febe44b7e9dedf2e3271c433b/58556/thinkabitlab.webp 800w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"drupal-portal-and-dashboard"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1121140491","513618840"]}
